Built with the guidance of our mentor, Jucimar Junior, and the help of an awesome team, this little game evolved beyond the classroom to explore new ideas and learn a bit of everything. :]`

# ![UFO](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc5cbe50-ee97-4a82-bf80-1c355cb8f659) [ What is Western Raid? ] ![UFO2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/780918b9-3c24-48ec-ad57-e9a93604b637)
Western Raid is a simple, Atari-inspired game that follows the core mechanics of the classic arcade game **Breakout**, but with a twist! 
Instead of breaking bricks, you protect them in a fast-paced, chaotic experience.

# About
**= SYNOPSIS =**

You're an alien (or two) stranded in the desert, and local bandits are not giving you the warmest welcome. 
With a limited timer, increasing difficulty, and a bit of randomness, your goal is simple: Survive!

**= GAMEPLAY =**

You control a shield to manually defend your UFO, keeping it safe until the timer runs out. The entire game is played with just four movement keys (WASD or Arrow Keys), 
but it also supports mouse inputs for navigating menus. It’s a full-on flip of the Breakout formula!

**= FEATURES =**

The original goal was to get the core gameplay working, but things got way more fun than expected. 
Now, I’m aiming to make it feel like an actual old-school arcade game!

The game is planned to offer a variety of goods, or bads, depending on your gamer tastes:
- **< 3 to 5 Levels >** Each with it's own theme and gameplay features!
- **< Co-op support >** Play with a friend—or use both hands like a true multitasker!
- **< Many Bandits >** Unique enemy types to add variety (and chaos)!
- **< Items, Power-ups, Pickups >** Because everyone loves loot!
- **< Score and other Stats >** Not too interesting, but if achievements are added, could be a fun goal to replay!
- **< Data Saving >** Keep track of your high scores! Local (or online?) leaderboards aren't planned as of yet, but could be a thing!
- **< Randomized Stuff >** The map, the enemies, the loot... Every run feels somewhat fresh!

# Built from Scratch
![brick_pile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2501864-4fee-4fbb-a3c7-25ccb370daa5) A lot of love (and lack of sleep) went into this, including:
- Programming & Logic
- Music
- Artwork
- This whole github charade
- Unecessary Details
- Somewhat Necessary But Still Nitpicky Details...

Big shoutout to my team for helping build the foundation—this wouldn't be what it is without them!

# Why Pygame?
Wish I had a good excuse, but Pygame just happens to be easy to work with and great for quick prototyping. Plus, I love games that don’t force you to grind but instead give you tools to have fun and get creative. This project is my small attempt at that!

_That said, don’t expect an ultra-engaging, endlessly replayable game like modern titles. It’s more of a fun little "one-and-done" experience you might complete when you have the time. 
But for what Pygame allows (especially when you're just starting out), I’m really happy with the results and everything I’m learning along the way!_ ![bot_shooter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cf8ec26-975e-4e29-b416-40380c9d35eb)

Thank you for reading this! (if it ever gets released, that is)
