# ![UFO](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc5cbe50-ee97-4a82-bf80-1c355cb8f659) [ What is Western Raid? ] ![UFO2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/780918b9-3c24-48ec-ad57-e9a93604b637)
It's a very simple, atari-inspired game that follows similar rules to the old arcade game **Breakout**, 
but instead of breaking the bricks, you protect them at all costs in a chaotic experience!

The premise is straightfoward: You are an alien (or two) that falls into the desert, and now have to protect yourself against not-so-greeting bandits.
Limited timer, gets progressively difficult and offers some randomization for better replayability.
The entire game can be played with no more than 4 movement keys! (WASD or ARROWS), and it also supports mouse inputs for menu accessibility.

Gameplay wise though? It's just pure movement, meant to replicate the breakout experience with a full-on flip on the concept!

I'm planning to make the game feel... well, like a game! Initially the goal was just to get the basic gameplay working and be there, done that.
However I got very motivated to see how this would look like as an actual old-fashined game, as if it was released all the way back to be stuck within those arcade machines for eternity!

The game is planned to offer a variety of goods, or bads, depending on your gamer tastes:
- **3 to 5 Levels!** Each with it's own theme and gameplay features
- **Co-op support!** Play with a friend or the other hand, anything that fits the band!
- **Bandits!** Different and unique bandits, giving color to the ~~massacre~~ fun!
- **Items, Power-ups, Pickups!** Anything that is loot is good loot
- **Score and other Stats!** Not too interesting, but if achievements are added, could be a fun goal to replay!
- **Data Saving!** This means you can fight for higher and higher scores, no account system for competitions against local buddies (yet)
- **Randomized Stuff!** The map, the enemies, the loot... It's all made to give you a somewhat new experience each time!


![brick_pile](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b2501864-4fee-4fbb-a3c7-25ccb370daa5) Almost everything was done from scratch: 
- Programming and Logic
- Music
- Artwork
- This whole github sharade
- Unecessary Details
- Somewhat Necessary But Still Nitpicky Details...

A lot of the initial logic was built with the help of my team though, so this wouldn't have gotten this far without them!

# But why make this? On PYGAME????
Wish I had a good excuse, but the very simplicity and easy access got the best of me (and my sleep schedule). However in terms of making a game like this out of anything out there, Id say I'm am very fond of games that don't force feed you the urge to play, but give you tools to have fun and share passion to spice that fun ten fold, so I ought to try something, atleast to see how that works!

_Though don't expect it to be engaging or "replayable" like most games nowadays, it's likely an one-and-done thing that you might feel like completing when you have the time. 
There's only so much you can do with pygame (especially when ur starting out lol), but I still really liked the results and the things i'm learning throughout!_

Hope whoever reads this can be interested, and I say this because I got no clue to who I'll send this to!
