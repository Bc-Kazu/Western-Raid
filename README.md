# What is Western Raid?
It's a very simple, atari-inspired game that follows similar rules to the old arcade game **Breakout**, 
but instead of breaking the bricks, you protect them at all costs in a chaotic experience!

The premise is straightfoward: You are an alien (or two) that falls into the desert, and now have to protect yourself against not-so-greeting bandits.
Limited timer, gets progressively difficult and offers some randomization for better replayability.

Almost everything was done from scratch: code, music, artwork, ideas, unnecessary details, somewhat necessary but still not important details...

Don't expect it to be like every other game out there, it's likely an one-and-done thing. 
There's only so much you can do with pygame (especially when ur starting out lol)
